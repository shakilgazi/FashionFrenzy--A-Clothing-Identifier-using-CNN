# FashionFrenzy: A Clothing Identifier using CNN

• Developed an image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that can identify the type of clothing in a given photo. 

• This project was completed using Python. Worked independently to clean, analyze and visualize the fashion dataset using python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib. 

• With the help of Keras, I create a CNN model and train it with 15 epochs. Finally, it is able to classify the image of fashion dataset.
