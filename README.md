# Garments Identification Machine using CNN

•	This system can identify the type of clothing in a given photo. Worked independently to clean, analyze, visualize and predict in given fashion dataset. 

•	This project was completed using Python. For analyze and visualize the dataset I use some python library like NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib. 

•	With the help of Keras, I create a CNN model and train it with 15 epochs. Finally, it is able to classify the image of fashion dataset.
